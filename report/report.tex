\begin{abstract}
  This paper presents simulation results of a decentralized control algorithm which maintains coherence of a robot swarm. The alpha algorithm is implemented at two different levels; a sub-microscopic level : a simulation using a controller over the interaction between agents and a macroscopic level : using a probabilistic finite state machine approach to emphasize the behavior of the whole swarm using transition state probabilities from the sub-microscopic level. We also investigate the extension of this algorithm, the beta algorithm, in a general movement towards beacons and the encapsulation phenomenon.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
  Modelling of swarm algorithms is important since it allows us to predict the overall behaviour of the swarm as well as study the influence of individual robot parameters on the swarm behaviour. Also swarm modelling is crucial for tasks such as validation of swarm algorithms before they can be deployed in real world situation. In this project we seek to model a wirelessly connected swarm at a macroscopic level and compare it to the same algorithm implemented in sub-microscopic simulation. As a first part of the project we implemented alpha algorithm (discussed below) in webots (sub-microscopic level), as a second part we modeled the same algorithm at a macroscopic level and as a third part we implemented an additional algorithm, beta algorithm, along with behaviours such as taxis towards a beacon and beacon encapsulation.\\

  
   Multi-level modelling approach is one of various modelling approaches where robot swarms are modelled at multiple levels corresponding to different levels of abstractions. 
The three main modelling levels are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Submicroscopic level}: In this level faithful reproduction of intra-robot interactions (e.g.,S\&A, transceiver) and environment details (physics, rendering) are carried out.  All mechanical and control processes are simulated as close as possible.  
  \item \textit{Microscopic level}: In this level the robots are modeled as state machines where state transitions are probabilistic rather than deterministic or event based like in the real robot controller. Only relevant robot features are captured and more focus is laid on average behavior as an individual such as amount of time spent in certain state or how often transition occurs between given states rather than the individual trajectory.
  \item \textit{Macroscopic level}: In this level new states resulting from the aggregation of the robotsâ€™ states are introduced. The entire swarm is modeled as one entity rather than a collection of multiple robots. In this level one seeks to model average behavior of swarm such as average number of robots in a certain state.
\end{itemize}

  We also studied movement of swarm of robots towards a beacon while ensuring obstacle avoidance. The later being an emergent property of the beta algorithm resulting from differentiation of certain robots from the rest. In section III we compare beta algorithm with alpha algorithm based on various metrics and present some visual results.

\section{Experiments}
  \subsection{State machine}
  The same state machine as presented in \cite{Winfield08} was used for both alpha simulation in webots and macroscopic modeling. 


  \begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/fsm.png}
      \caption{Robot finite state machine \cite{Winfield08}}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

COHERENCE and FORWARD states each contain AVOIDANCE state which means obstacle avoidance is ensured at all times. Robots are initially in FORWARD state and transition to COHERENCE state is only triggered if the number of neighbors falls below a certain  threshold. The robot moves back to FORWARD state after spending a certain amount of time in COHERENCE state at which point the robot may or may not have recovered the swarm. Obstacle avoidance behaviour is implemented using a simple weight based Breitenberg controller.


  \subsection{Experimental setup} \label{simulations}
  We used the realistic simulation software Webots (developped by Cyberbotics, an EPFL spin-off startup). Webots offers realistic 3D rendering of scenes as well as physics simulation. We use an open (``infinite'') arena with 40 agents. Each agent is a submicroscopic-level representation of the E-Puck robot: the model is complete with each sensor, actuators, etc. We leverage realistic communication simulation to limit the range of communication to a fixed radius around each agent. Messages are delivered after a delay. However, make the symplifying assumption that messages are received as they were sent, i.e. without corruption or noise over the contents of the message.\\

  We implemented the alpha algorithm as presented in \cite{Winfield08} which is a simpler version of beta algorithm presented in \cite{Nembrini02}. In alpha algorithm robots are in a default state of forward motion until the number of connections drops below a certain threshold. All the robots are equipped with a short range radio communication device (communication range is often much smaller than the size of the swarm) and are able to ``sense'' the number of robots that are within their communication range. At every time step each robot keeps track of number of its neighbors. If the number of neighbors fall below a certain threshold (dictated by alpha parameter) the robot switches form FORWARD state to COHERENCE state. In both states obstacle avoidance is ensured with the help of IR sensors onboard the robot. FORWARD and COHERENCE states are preemptive over AVOIDANCE in that state change to FORWARD or COHERENCE while at AVOIDANCE causes the robot to immediately stop AVOIDANCE and switch to the new state.  Hence the robots behave as if they were attached to each other via an elastic band. In COHERENCE state the robot tries to recover the swarm by turning 180 degrees in place and hence moving backwards. The robot makes a random turn if the number of connections rises following a COHERENCE move to recover the swarm. One drawback of alpha algorithm is that the swarm is very sensitive to communication loss and hence tends to collapse on itself while trying to recover too often.

  Just like in alpha algorithm in beta algorithm robots are equipped with basic collision avoidance sensors and short range omnidirectional radio for communication. In addition, each robot is equipped with a beacon sensor. In terms of locomotive capabilities each robot is capable of moving forward in a straight line as well as making a turn in place with reasonable accuracy. In our simulations we use all 8 infrared sensors onboard the robot and a simple weight based Breitenberg controller to achieve obstacle avoidance behaviour. A beacon is introduced with line of sight occlusion in order to study the collective movement of swarm towards a certain point.\\

  While each robot can tell if a certain robot is in its communication range (based on exchanged messages) any kind of absolute or relative pose of neighbors is not available to the robots. Each robot broadcasts its neighborhood information (IDs of its current/latest neighbors) at a regular time interval unlike alpha algorithm where each robot only sends ``I am here'' messages. This additional information allows for a different locomotive strategy resulting in a more flexible swarm and results in many more additional emergent behaviours. In alpha algorithm we saw that as the number of robots in the swarm increases the swarm as a whole becomes more and more reactive (since robots reacts to every communication loss) and clumps together. In beta algorithm such overreactivity is overcome by exploiting the additional neighborhood information available to each robot. Unlike alpha algorithm in beta algorithm a robot reacts to a communication loss only when the lost robot is shared by less than a certain number (given by parameter ``beta'' and hence the name of the algorithm) of neighbors. In other words, as long as a good number of neighbors are in the range of the lost robot swarm recovery behaviour is not triggered. This allows the swarm to be more flexible and thus eliminates the problem of entire swarm collapsing on itself like we saw with the alpha algorithm. Additionally robots take a random heading if the number of connections rises over time.\\

  \subsection{Implementation}
  The submicroscopic models for alpha and beta algorithms were implemented in webots in C. The macroscopic modelling was carried out in Matlab. In order to derive probability estimates for the macroscopic model state of each robot was logged at every time step in webots. \\

  For beta algorithm two metrics were implemented : area-coverage and taxis towards beacon. For both of these metrics first a convex hull of robot positions was computed. For area-coverage area of the polygon defined by this convex hull was calculated. Similarly distance between the beacon and the centroid of the convex hull was used to compute taxis metrics. Results are presented in section III.

      \caption{Realistic simulation in Webots}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Macroscopic model}
  The macroscopic model of this wireless connected swarm is established from a set of differential equations (DE) described in \cite{Winfield08}. DEs precisely describe the rules governing state transitions at each timestep.\\

  The set of DEs can be separate into two hierarchical groups in a particle finite state machine (PFSM). In our case, the state machine has the following states:\\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Forward (with subsumed state avoidance)
    \item Coherence (with subsumed state avoidance)
  \end{itemize}

  The sub-PFSM can be written simply from the conservation principle since the number of time steps to spend in avoidance is constant and known. The related terms are $N_F$, $N_{AF}$, $N_C$ and $N_{AC}$, for forward, avoidance-forward, coherence and avoidance-coherence states respectively.

  The PFSM can be expressed as the rate of change of the number of robots $N$ at state $X$ over timesteps $k$ for a given number of neighbors $i$:
  \[
    \frac{dN_{X_i}}{dt} \approx \frac{\Delta N_X}{\Delta_t} = N_{X_i}(k+1) - N_{X_i}(k)
  \]

  Then, the input and output for each DE are derived from the probability to change the state of a robot to X considering his current number of neighbors. The states $X$ are $N_{\bar F}$ and $N_{\bar C}$. There are six different state transition probabilities defined for the macroscopic model:

  \begin{table}[h]
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{r|l}
        \hline
        Notation   & Corresponding event \\
        \hline
        $P_a$      & go in avoidance \\
        $P_g$      & gain a connection in Forward \\
        $P_l$      & lost a connection in Forward \\
        $P_r$      & recover a connection in Coherence \\
        $P_f$      & fail to recover a connection in Coherence \\
        $P_{la}$   & lost a connection in Coherence \\
        \hline
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
  \end{table}

  Those probabilities were estimated from data collected from the submicroscopic simulations described in \ref{simulations} over 3 runs of $25 000$ timesteps. The probabilities are define as the total amount of robots that actually fulfilled the condition over the concerned population at $i$ connection. For instance, the probability to go in avoidance concerned the whole population at $i$ connection, when the probability to loose a connection in Forward only concerned the robots in Forward and Avoidance Forward states.

  The macroscopic model ran for $1000$ timesteps, estimating at each steps the number of robots for the next iteration in each state based on the set of DEs and the state transition probabilities, as rates of change coefficients:
  \[
    PY_i * N(X|PY)_i
  \]

  with $PY$ denoting any of the probabilities ($Y \in \{a, g, l, r, f, la\}$); and $N(X|PY)$ the number of robots in the affected state (knowing which one)

  For example, if we consider the state transition of robots which fail to recover a connection $Pf$, the related state knowing the consider probability $N(X|Pf)$ is the coherence state $N_{\bar C}$


\section{Results}
  In figure \ref{fig:main-results}, we compare the aggregated results of 10 runs of the submicroscopic model (left) with those of the macroscopic model (right). We are interested in the capacity of the macroscopic model to mimick the simulation runs.

  The results show the expected global tendency with a clearly visible mode centered on alpha. But some aspects aren't similar, the extremities dropped to zero too quickly, especially in the increasing side of the number of connections. As a consequence, the number of robots is higher than expected around the mode, in particular for the avoidance state. This could indicate a too low value for the rate of transition induced in the estimation of the transition state probabilities.\\

  To investigate the phenomena, the macroscopic model were tested using the results of \cite{Winfield08}, the model showed results similar to the article. This confirms the validity of the results as well as our implementation.

  Especially because this behavior still occurs for more calibration data and more simulation time steps, thus the generation of the probabilities is certainly the source of it. \\

  Figure \ref{fig:metrics} shows various metrics computed for beta algorithm. The figure on the left shows area-coverage for different number of robots for different $beta$ values. As expected for 40 robots and beta equals 1 the area coverage is maximum. This is also in line with what was presented in \cite{Nembrini02}.

  The figure on the right shows taxis of the swarm towards the beacon for different swarm sizes ($beta = 2$ for both). We can see that for larger swarm the taxis rate is faster as more robots are occluded resulting in more differentiation of robots and hence the emergent behavior. Compared to the swarm of 40 robots for 30 robots at the end of $1400 \times 20$ time steps the swarm is not quite at the beacon. 

  We have also presented some snapshots in figure \ref{fig:snaps} from the simulation involving collective movement towards a beacon where the swarm passes through obstacles.

\section{Conclusion}
In this project, we studied the multi-level modeling of a simple swarm algorithm, the alpha algorithm as well as a slightly more sophisticated version, the beta algorithm. Our results demonstrated the expected emergent behavior: the swarm maintains its  coherent state over time. Moreover, using probabilities estimated from the submicroscopic simulations, we were able to verify that the macroscopic model lead to results coherent with the submicroscopic simulation observations. The main differences in between the different modeling levels were introduced most certainly during the state transition probability estimation process. The beta algorithm turns out to be less sensitive to communication loss and unlike alpha algorithm does not tend to ``clump'' on itself and hence is more flexible. Moreover, various emergent properties were observed such as taxis towards a beacon and beacon encapsulation. Finally, the swarm was able to make its way thorugh the obstacles while moving towards the beacon.
